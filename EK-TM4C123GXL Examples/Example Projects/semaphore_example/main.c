/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project provides a simple demonstration on how to control GPIO as both
 * inputs and outputs and how to use a binary semaphore to defer ISR processing
 * to an individual task to keep the ISR processing very light.  The RGB LED on
 * the EK-TM4C123GXL is configured with the standard PinoutSet() function.  The
 * buttons are used to change between colors with the rotation from
 * red->blue->green being reversed between the left and right buttons.
 *
 * main() creates one binary semaphore and one task.  It then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * The binary semaphore is used to keep the LED task in a blocked state until
 * an interrupt fires from a switch input.
 *
 * The LED task configures the buttons, initializes the LED, and starts the
 * task which will handle the processing for the input switches to toggle
 * between the various LED colors.
 *
 * This example uses UARTprintf for output of UART messages.  UARTprintf is not
 * a thread-safe API and is only being used for simplicity of the demonstration
 * and in a controlled manner.
 *
 * Open a terminal with 115,200 8-N-1 to see the output for this demo.

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
