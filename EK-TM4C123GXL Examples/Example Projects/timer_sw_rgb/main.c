/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project demonstrates how to run multiple FreeRTOS software timers to
 * control the RGB LED on the EK-TM4C123GXL.  The RGB LEDs on the EK-TM4C123GXL
 * are configured with the standard PinoutSet() function.  The three software
 * timers then run at different rates in order to toggle the three different
 * colors of the RGB LED in order to cycle through all iteration of the LED
 * colors.
 *
 * main() creates one task.  It then starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Software Timer task creates three software timers which have periods of
 * 1, 2, and 4 seconds respectively.  Each timer is associated with a specific
 * RGB color: Timer 1 for Red, Timer 2 for Blue, and Timer 3 for Green.  When
 * a timeout callback is triggered, the associated LED is toggled.

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
