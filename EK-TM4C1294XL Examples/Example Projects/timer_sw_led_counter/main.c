/******************************************************************************
 *
 * This project demonstrates how to run multiple FreeRTOS software timers to
 * control the four LEDs on the EK-TM4C1294XL.  The LEDs on the EK-TM4C1294XL
 * are configured with the standard PinoutSet() function.  The four software
 * timers then run at different rates in order to toggle the LEDs to create a
 * binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 in binary endlessly.  The LED count
 * is updated every second.
 *
 * main() creates one task.  It then starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Software Timer task creates four software timers which have periods of
 * 0.5, 1, 2,and 4 seconds respectively.  Each timer is associated with a
 * specific LED on the EK-TM4C1294XL: Timer 1 for D4, Timer 2 for D3, Timer 3
 * for D2, and Timer 4 for D1.  When a timeout callback is triggered, the
 * associated LED is toggled.

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
